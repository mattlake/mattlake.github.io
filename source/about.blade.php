    <p class="mb-6">I am a child of the 80s, with a young family living in a sleepy village in Gloucestershire.</p>
    <p class="mb-6">My first line of code was on a Commodore 64 when I was in primary school, and had the bug ever since.</p>
    <p class="mb-6">By day I am a Software Engineer in telecoms in the UK, using mostly .NET and PHP.
        By night I am a husband and father of two. In any spare time I can find, I usually turn to Lego or Xbox.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        Having worked in a few industries previously, I rekindled an interest for code in my spare time.
        This interest led to a ‘fulltime’ hobby consuming most spare minutes I had.
        I learnt multiple languages from online resources and courses, expanding my knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS, PHP, javaScript, and Python.
